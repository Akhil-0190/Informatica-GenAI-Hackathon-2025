# Critical Resource Management System

Efficiently manage your enterpriseâ€™s critical resources with AI-powered insights, optimization, and automation. 

## Problem Statement

Enterprises face inefficiencies managing critical resources due to fragmented data, causing shortages, wastage, and disruptions. Generative AI integration ensures real-time insights and optimization.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Forecasts**: Predict resource consumption trends to avoid shortages and wastage.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Real-time alerts for unusual patterns in resource usage.
- **Automated Replenishment**: Automatically trigger restocking based on predefined thresholds.
- **Stock Replenishment Logs**: Transparent logs tracking all replenishment activities.
- **Usage Level Insights**: Detailed trends in resource usage to identify optimization opportunities.
- **Resource Composition Visualization**: Clear breakdown of resource types and their availability.

## How It Works

The system leverages AI and analytics to provide:

- **Forecasting**: Uses historical data to predict resource depletion timelines and consumption trends.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Monitors usage data in real-time to identify irregularities and sends alerts.
- **Automated Replenishment**: Tracks stock levels and initiates restocking when thresholds are reached.
- **Detailed Insights**: Provides usage level trends, resource composition charts, and replenishment logs for transparency and decision-making.
